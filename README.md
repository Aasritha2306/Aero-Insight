Planning air travel involves uncertainty in ticket pricing, leading to difficulty in budgeting and decision-making for travellers.
 This project aims to build a machine-learning model that predicts flight ticket prices depending on different variables that possibly impact the fare.
Our approach is to utilize historical flight data and machine learning algorithms to predict future prices and Identify key determinants impacting flight costs.

Source: Kaggle.com, obtained from the "Ease my Trip" website.

Data Description:

-Variables: The dataset includes various features such as Airline, departure/arrival city, route, number of stops, duration, departure/arrival time, etc.

-Data Types: All input variables mentioned above are of object data type in the source data.

-Target Variable: The target variable is "price", with a data type of int64.

This comprehensive dataset from Ease My Trip provides a rich source of information for our predictive modeling project, allowing us to explore the relationships between various flight parameters and ticket prices.
